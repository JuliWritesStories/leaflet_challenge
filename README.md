# leaflet_challenge
For this challenge, I created a heatmap for earthquake data using leaflet. Every pop-up can be selected to view the magnitude, depth, and location of the earthquake. The pop-ups increase in size based on magnitude and change color based on depth. A legend for depth color ranges is viewable in the right hand corner. I was assisted by chat gpt.
